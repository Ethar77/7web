Welcome to  CADEAU ( The Flowers & Candle 🌺🕯️)

Discover the enchanting world where flowers, with their diverse sizes, shapes, colors, and arrangements, embody a shared structural elegance. More than just botanical wonders, these blossoms symbolize beauty, love, and tranquility, becoming the very essence of a garden and a conduit of nature's message to humanity.

At CADEAU, we extend our care beyond the floral realm, ensuring that every moment in your space is accompanied by the warm glow of our meticulously crafted candles. Our candles are more than just sources of light – they are hand-poured using 100% natural soy wax, boasting natural cotton wicks. Committed to a cruelty-free philosophy, our candles are void of lead, plastic, paraben, phthalates, or synthetic dyes.

Indulge your senses in our carefully selected fragrance oils, expertly blended to evoke unique scents that bring the essence of the Middle East into your home, office, or to your loved ones. Immerse yourself in the harmonious blend of nature's beauty and the warm embrace of our artisan candles at CADEAU.
